# HotYoke

HotYoke helps you circumvent the issue of bad connectivity. With HotYoke, you can pay a small amount of money to use someone else’s hotspot if you’re facing connectivity problems. And if you have fast internet, a generous data plan and the desire to earn some money, you can be the one providing hotspot to others near you.

This repo includes the code for our iOS app, SQL database, and our website.
